      <h5>Here I shall be sharing a couple fun games I enjoy that feature antrhopomorphic characters and I think would apeal to other furries.</h5>
      <h3>Changed</h3>
      <p>The first game I shall share with you is the indie game Changed, this is a personaly favorite of mine. Changed is a action exploration and puzzle game, it has a great story and amazing art style and features many anthropomorphic characters throughout the game. Changed can be a very challenging game so if you want to check it out be prepared to spend a bit of time solving the puzzles! You can find this game on windows availible through steam and possibly other sites.</p>
      <h3>VR Chat</h3>
      <p>The next and last game I will share with you is VR Chat, this game is completely based on the user, the avatars you use and the games you play are almost all user made so the game is open to all kinds of people. I put this game in this list because a lot of furries like myself enjoy playing this game because amongs the huge variety of avatars you can use thier are all kinds of anthro ones and you can get your own made. If you want to check this game out you can get it on steam or through a vr headset!</p>
